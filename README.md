> Script that makes tasks working time and adds to google spreadsheet

## How to use it
Simply run the python script with command:
```shell
$ python .\spreatsheet_entry.py
```
It will ask what task you will perform, then the script will run until you exit using **CTRL + C**. It will write to the sheet specified in the code.

### What goes in the sheet
What the script will add to the sheet is a row with `DATE,TIME-START,TIME-END,TIME-SPENT,TASK`
